# ShipStation API Webhook Simulator 📦

A lightweight Node.js utility designed to simulate high-fidelity ShipEngine (SSAPI) tracking webhooks. This tool allows developers to test tracking integrations for **FedEx, UPS, and USPS** without needing real-world tracking numbers or carrier API credentials.

## 🚀 Features
- **Multi-Carrier Support**: Pre-configured templates for FedEx, UPS, and USPS using authentic carrier event codes.
- **Dynamic Time-Travel**: Automatically calculates `occurred_at` and `carrier_occurred_at` timestamps based on relative offsets to simulate a multi-day journey.
- **Web Dashboard**: A built-in UI to trigger simulations, customize tracking numbers, and select statuses (Accepted, In Transit, Exception, Delivered).
- **Activity Log**: Real-time history of fired webhooks directly on the dashboard.
- **Security Ready**: Includes simulated ShipEngine HMAC/RSA headers for signature verification testing.
